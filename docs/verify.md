# Verification Checks

The Laravel adapter declares **8 verification checks**. They validate that an artifact looks like a deployable Laravel application before it is installed on a server.

## Where the checks run

The checks run during **Release install** on the server — `anvil server release install <project-id> <artifact>` (and its equivalent `anvil deployment install <target-id> <artifact>`):

1. Generic artifact integrity verification must pass first (`artifact must be verified first` otherwise)
2. Then every declared adapter check runs against the artifact
3. **All 8 must pass** — a single failure fails the install with:

```text
adapter verification failed: <check-name>: <details>; ...
```

If the adapter binary is missing, install fails earlier with `adapter executable "anvil-adapter-laravel" not found on PATH ...`.

## The checks

| # | Check | Validates | Failure message (details) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `vendor_present` | `vendor/autoload.php` exists — Composer dependencies are installed and autoloadable | `missing required file(s): vendor/autoload.php` |
| 2 | `bootstrap_structure` | `bootstrap/app.php` exists — application bootstrap is present | `missing required file(s): bootstrap/app.php` |
| 3 | `config_files` | `config/app.php` **and** `.env.example` both exist | `missing required file(s): config/app.php, .env.example` |
| 4 | `artisan_file` | `artisan` CLI entrypoint exists at the project root | `missing required file(s): artisan` |
| 5 | `composer_json` | `composer.json` exists at the project root | `missing required file(s): composer.json` |
| 6 | `env_file` | `.env` **or** `.env.example` exists (either one passes) | `neither .env nor .env.example found` |
| 7 | `app_directory` | `app/` directory exists | `missing required directory: app` |
| 8 | `routes_directory` | `routes/` directory exists | `missing required directory: routes` |

The checks work against both extracted directories and artifact archives (tar.gz) — no full extraction is performed for archive inspection.

## Practical notes

- Because `vendor/` must pass check #1, the artifact must contain `vendor/`. Note that `anvil init --framework laravel` no longer writes a framework-specific artifact configuration — the Core applies framework-agnostic compiled defaults (TS-015-01-03), and the compiled `artifact.exclude` default strips `vendor/**`, so new Laravel projects package **without** `vendor/` until a mechanism that can supply framework artifact defaults exists. Config extension content (TS-015-03-01) and template content (TS-015-02-03) do **not** close the gap: extension content carries framework-namespaced config keys only (`framework.<name>.*`) and template content supplies pipeline files only — neither touches the Core-owned `artifact.exclude` key; the closing mechanism is standard content extraction (EPIC-016/EPIC-018; see [limitations item 6](https://github.com/maleolabs/forge-anvil-cli/blob/develop/wiki/limitations.md)). Today, restore `vendor/` by overriding the exclude list in `anvil.yaml`: set `artifact.exclude` to the compiled defaults minus `vendor/**` (do **not** use `artifact.include: [vendor/**]` — a non-empty include list acts as a strict whitelist and would drop every non-vendor file). Without `vendor/` in the artifact, install fails on `vendor_present`.
- Check #6 accepts `.env.example` so CI-built artifacts without real secrets can still pass. On the server, link the real `.env` via `--shared-link from=shared/config/.env,to=.env` at project registration (see [deploy.md](deploy.md)).

## CLI verification: `anvil artifact verify`

`anvil artifact verify <path>` runs the **generic integrity checks** — archive validity, manifest presence/content, and checksum match — and then the adapter-declared framework checks (the 8 Laravel checks above) when the active project declares a framework and the adapter is installed (`runFrameworkVerification`, 005-adapter-command-contract §4, TS-P7-11). The adapter is optional (ADR-009 §9.7): without a framework, or with a missing adapter executable, verification runs the generic checks only (a warning is printed when the executable is missing). A present but failing adapter fails the verification with a non-zero exit. See [limitations](https://github.com/maleolabs/forge-anvil-cli/blob/develop/wiki/limitations.md).
