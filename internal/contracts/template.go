// The template command contract payloads (TS-007-038) are defined in
// this file. They are data payloads only, consistent with the rest of
// the package: through the `template` command (contracts.CommandTemplate)
// the Core fetches the pipeline definitions the adapter owns — the build
// pipeline and the CI pipeline — at generation time, replacing the
// Core-embedded template functions (ADR-020 §1: framework knowledge
// moves OUT of the Core binary INTO the adapter binaries).
//
// The definitions are carried as pipeline.PipelineDefinition — the
// standard-side mirror of the type the Core's pipeline loader
// (internal/execution) parses and validates — so the Core can validate
// the standard's output through the existing loader before writing it to
// .anvil/pipelines/. The struct field names and yaml tags are copied
// verbatim from the Core type so the JSON the standard emits unmarshals
// into the Core's type unchanged (the wire shape of the template command
// is part of the subprocess contract). The import is one-directional:
// internal/pipeline does not import internal/contracts, so no import
// cycle exists.

// templates); the Core currently needs no per-call parameters.
