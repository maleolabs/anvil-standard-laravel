// Package contracts defines the stable command contract exchanged between
// the Anvil Core and delivery lifecycle standards via subprocess
// invocation.
//
// This package is the standard-side mirror of the Core's contract types
// (maleolabs.com/anvil/internal/contracts, EPIC-014/EPIC-015): the JSON
// wire format is the subprocess contract (ADR-025 §3.4 — the contract is
// preserved unchanged across the repository split). The types are data
// payloads only — they carry the contract between Core and standards and
// do not define behavior. The JSON tags reproduce the Core field names
// exactly; changing a tag or field name here breaks the wire contract.
//
// Per 004-review-resolutions D1, Core↔Standard integration is a CLI
// subprocess command contract. Standards are standalone executables in
// any language; the Core invokes them through the Process Runner
// (ADR-008) with structured JSON input, and standards return structured
// JSON output with a defined exit code convention (ADR-010 §8.1). No Go
// interfaces, no in-process calls, and no plugin mechanism are used.
//
